# Spell Checker Using Hash Table

This program is a spell checker application coded in C. It uses a hash table with chaining to load in a dictionary and perform fast lookups. The spell checker also uses [Levenshtein Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) to provides suggestions in case of misspelled words.

A set of skeleton files were provided to start (Assignment 6, Oregon State University, CS 261 - Spring 2017). The spell checker application and majority portion of hash table with chaining data structure were implemented by self.

## Instructions
